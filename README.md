# Academic & Curriculum Knowledge Search Agent

AI agent for searching academic and curriculum knowledge bases, built with Agentic Star.

## Overview

Retrieval-augmented Q&A over a curated education-regulatory knowledge base: MEXT
course-of-study guidelines, NIAD-QE accreditation standards, curriculum requirements,
and institutional policies. Faculty, curriculum designers, and administrative or
accreditation staff ask a natural-language question and receive a grounded answer with
a per-claim source citation, so they can verify every statement against the actual
guideline text instead of manually scanning long, frequently updated documents. The
shipped build is deterministic and network-free over a seeded JSON knowledge base —
keyword retrieval plus rule-based grounded answer assembly, with a documented seam for
upgrading to LLM synthesis and a live vector store. Every answer carries a numbered
Sources list and a standing advisory disclaimer, behind a mandatory output security
gate. Callers can pass structured parameters (`category`, `top_k`) via `input_context`;
every caller parameter is validated fail-closed. No student records are read, stored,
or referenced anywhere — the knowledge base is regulatory/administrative content only.

This is an agent template built with the **AGENTIC STAR** development platform and the
**AgentCore Framework**. It is intended to be taken as a starting point: fork it, adapt it to
your own data and policies, and run it inside your own AGENTIC STAR deployment.

## Requirements

**This template does not run standalone.** It requires:

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| **AGENTIC STAR platform** | The agent connects to the platform at start-up. Without it, start-up fails immediately (see *Behaviour without the platform* below). Deployment guides and API documentation: [AGENTIC STAR Developers](https://developers.fd.agenticstar.tm.softbank.jp/) |
| **AgentCore Framework** (`agenticstar-agentcore`) | Installed from PyPI as a dependency. |
| Python | >=3.11 |

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Behaviour without the platform

The framework is designed to run **only** on AGENTIC STAR. There is no fallback or degraded
mode. If the platform is unreachable or the SDK version does not match, the agent
fails at graph compile / start-up preflight rather than starting in a partially
working state. This is intentional — a half-running agent is worse than one that refuses to start.

## Quick Start

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

Tests run without a platform connection. Running the agent itself does not.

## Project Structure

```
src/          agent implementation (nodes, services, schemas)
tests/        unit, integration and boundary tests
config/       agent configuration
docs/         design and operational documentation
```

See `docs/` for the design and the test specification.

## Customising

1. Adjust `config/` for your own environment and policies.
2. Replace the knowledge sources and sample data with your own.
3. Review the node implementations under `src/nodes/` for domain-specific logic.
4. Re-run the test suite.
